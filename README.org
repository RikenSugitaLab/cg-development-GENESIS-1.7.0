* Implementation of residue-level coarse-grained models in GENESIS for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations

  This repository is used to share simulation data for the publication of:
  
  - Tan C, Jung J, Kobayashi C, Torre DUL, Takada S, Sugita Y (2022) Implementation of residue-level coarse-grained models in GENESIS for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. PLoS Comput Biol 18(4): e1009578. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009578

  
** Softwares

   In this work we report our implementation of CG models in the GENESIS software.
   The softwares and user guide documents are open to public:
   - GENESIS v1.7.0: https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/labs/cbrt/genesis-version-1-7/
   - GENESIS-CG-tool: https://github.com/noinil/genesis_cg_tool
  
** Directory structure

   We put all the MD simulation files in the =simulation_files= subdirectory.
   With these files one can reproduce all the results we report in the paper.
   To reduce the total file size of this repository, we don't include any trajectory.
